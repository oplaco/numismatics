 Java desktop application to manage euro coin collection
 
Numeroues assumptions have been made. For instance the application does not take into account conmemorative coins and all the years between 1999 and 2022 are shown for every country when a lot of then didnÂ´t issue any currency in some of those years.

# use guide
When the user first open the application, he must create a new collection via file/new. The next time he can open the previously created collection or create a new one. After a collection is opened the user can change between countries clicking on the multiple countries buttons. To add/remove coins, use the add/remove button and introduce the coin year (yyyy) and face value (d.dd). To swap tho the statistics scene, click the statistics button and then click 'load statistics' to visualize the data.
